Future Goals:
 1. Add Exception Handling to "handle" error's caused by typing non-integers into the Guess variable.
  
 2. If Exception Handling is triggered, restart the attempt and remind the player to enter a number into the field.
  
 3. Open a relevant URL from a pre-defined list that is determinant on the games outcome.
