# Gambling-Hot-or-Cold-Style
A simple 50/50 game of chance built to showcase my knowledge of Python into a tangible program.

Future Goals:
  Add Exception Handling to "handle" error's caused by typing non-integers into the Guess variable.
  If Exception Handling is triggered, restart the attempt and remind the player to enter a number into the field.
  Make the feeling of winning or losing special. Possibly by opening a random URL from a revelant list determinant on the games outcome.
